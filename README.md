# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## USER STORY
- "As a developer, I have a need to create notes or code snippets regardless of whether I have an internet connection. This ensures that I can reliably retrieve and utilize them at a later time."
  
## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- When you open the text editor web application, you'll notice a neat client-server folder structure.
- As you run npm run start from the root directory, the backend will kick into action and serve the client.
- If you launch the text editor application from your terminal, you'll see that your JavaScript files are bundled up nicely with webpack.
- Using webpack plugins? You'll get a shiny new HTML file, a service worker, and a manifest file.
- Don't worry about using next-gen JavaScript in your app; the text editor will work smoothly in the browser without any hiccups.
- Open the text editor and voil√†! IndexedDB sets up a database storage for you right away.
- Type away in the editor, and if you click elsewhere on the page, rest assured your content gets saved with IndexedDB.
- Closed the text editor and feeling nostalgic? Open it up again and your content will be right there, thanks to IndexedDB.
- Want the app on your desktop? Click the Install button and you'll get a neat little icon for it.
- Loading your web application ensures a registered service worker is in place, all thanks to workbox.
- Register a service worker and watch as your static assets get pre-cached, along with any subsequent pages and assets.
- Deploying to Heroku? Your webpack application will have all the right build scripts ready to go.
